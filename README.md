## Development
WindViz is written in ES 2016 and built using babel, webpack, and npm.
### Dependencies

- npm and Node.js [(download link)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- git [(download link)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Quickstart (dev server)

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd windviz`
3. `npm install && npm start`

### Production Bundles

The development server does not overwrite any of the javascript bundles in `./dist`. To build these bundles use `npm run build`. This will overwrite all files in `./dist`.
